# Debato
Hi! thank you for checking out the debato Github page. What is debato? Debato is an online platform that accommodates online debates on topics big an small. regular online discussions can quickly turn into a bottomless pit of mindless shouting and other noise. This results in many people not even getting involved or finding it a waste of time to formulate proper arguments. By filtering out the qualitative arguments and by structuring arguments and sub-discussions, debato allows anyone to share their thoughts and points of view. And why stop there? Because debato is built on the decentralized Steem blockchain, writing thoughtful and interesting arguments or discussions can get you paid!
