# Debato



Hi! thank you for checking out the debato Github page. Debato is an online platform that accommodates online debates on topics big an small. It is built on the decentralized Steem blockchain because no one should dictate what can be discussed. As an added benefit users can get rewarded for creating interesting discussions or leaving thoughtful arguments!



## Files
There are a few html pages that make up the site, each has a personal javascript file for page specific operations + 1 common javascript file for more common functions.



If you want to help out with this project, make sure to check @debato on [busy](https://busy.org/@debato), [steemit](steemit.com/@debato), [Steempeak](https://steempeak.com/@debato) or any other steem platform you like, to see the vision of the project and what we are currently working on!
