Hi! welcome on the debato Github page. What is debato? Debato is an online platform that accommodates online debates on topics big an small. We all are passionate about certain topics, and it can happen that a difference in opinion leads to conversations that resemble a bottomless pit of arguments and acquisitions. This results in many people not even getting involved or finding it a waste of time to formulate proper arguments. By filtering out the qualitative arguments and by structuring arguments and sub-discussions, debato allows anyone to share their thoughts and points of view in a clear way. And why stop there? Because debato is built on the decentralized Steem blockchain, writing thoughtful and interesting arguments or discussions can get you paid!

  

If you want to contribute to this project, make sure to check @debato on [busy](https://busy.org/@debato), [steemit](steemit.com/@debato), [Steempeak](https://steempeak.com/@debato) or any other steem platform you like, or keep an eye on this GitHub repository and the [Twitter profile]([https://twitter.com/debato_org](https://twitter.com/debato_org)).

## Files

This repository can be used by anyone to propose changes, create new features or fix present problems. Folders are self explanatory, each html page imports its own JavaScript and CSS file with the same file name, a 'commons' JavaScript file for common functions such as upvoting, commenting, loading arguments etc. and a general layout.css file for general layout rules.

Images (banner and favicon) are stored in the imgs folder as vector files so feel free to propose new styles.

## Ideas

### Long term plans

- **Display statistics about a discussion** (distribution of age, gender, location... on the different sides of the topic). In the long term this might prove interesting to see how other variables correlate with certain points of view. Of course this would imply that users give up certain personal information. If wanted, this can also be encouraged by offering points in a point system. Whether this conflicts with the original idea that anyone can be anonymous on the blockchain can be debated.

- **Displaying the structure of the discussion you are currently viewing**. Interactively showing where you are in the vast tree structure of debates. As discussions get complex and with a lot of sub discussions it is important that a user can navigate in and between topics. Discussions will develop a tree structure with arguments and sub arguments and climbing this tree should be made clear and convenient.

- **A system of points** (using Smart Media Tokens (SMT)) for rewarding authors and popular discussions/arguments. A system like this can give interesting incentives for users to start controversial discussions and formulate their opinions thoughtfully.

- **A leader board/ranking system** to provide additional incentives for engaging with thoughtful comments and debate. Having a leader board were users can view there position according to others might provide an additional motivation to be engaged in debates.

  

### Short term plans

-  **A value indicator to show how much your vote is worth when sliding the Voting Power slider.**  I think this is very useful to adjust the voting power you vote with on debato.

- **Storing draft discussions.**  Storing drafts on your browser can be useful when working on an elaborate discussion context. The user then does not need to finish the discussion directly and can revisit it later

- **An upload function for the discussion thumbnail.**  Currently you have to enter a image URL to be used as thumbnail. Making it possible to upload an image directly from your computer can be a useful tool for people who want to use images they own already.

-    **Showing when an argument or discussion is edited.**  With the new feature of editing arguments and discussions it is also important to be able to see when a post was edited. Viewing the edit history can be interesting to understand comments on it that seem out of place.

-   **Adding button animations and disabling buttons when first clicked**  To provide an additional feedback when a button is pressed, animations will be added and the button will be visually disabled as well. This to increase the 'satisfaction' of pressing a button and to reduce the odds of a user pressing multiple times to reduce chance of failure.
  
## How can you contribute?

-   As a developer, this is my first major project. So I don't mind feedback on issues such as inefficient/improper syntax or spelling mistakes.
    
-   suggesting features that are of great value to the project and not already mentioned in the planned changes, here or on  [GitHub](https://github.com/samvanemelen/debato "This link will take you away from steemit.com").
    

-   Existing steemJS functions do not allow for complex queries. you can, for example, get the posts of a certain user, but then you can't specify a tag. This is currently resolved by loading the maximum amount of posts (100) and filtering those further. But this is not the best way when scaling up the project. Another option is to use  [steemSQL](https://steemsql.com/ "This link will take you away from steemit.com")  but this is only viable when the project has grown to a certain extend where it can support a 20 SBD per month subscription fee. Until then, other alternatives for more advanced querying of posts are more then welcome.
-   Some people experience issues when they go to debato via  [https://www.debato.org](https://www.debato.org/ "This link will take you away from steemit.com"). An message appears saying 'Your connection is not private'. URL's with just 'https://' work fine and URL's with 'www.' work well. If there is anyone with more experience that can point out where it goes wrong?
-   If you can think of anything else, feel free!
