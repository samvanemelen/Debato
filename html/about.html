                        <div class="infoItem">
                            <p>Debato is a platform that accommodates online debates. We all are passionate about certain
                                topics, but on the internet it can happen that a difference in opinion leads to an endless shouting pit.
                                By filtering out qualitative arguments and structuring them in sub-discussions we accommodate thoughtful debate
                                That are pleasant to interact width.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because Debato is built on the Steem blockchain framework there is no centralized authority
                                determining what debates are published or that can limit you from speaking your mind.
                                On top of that, posting arguments and discussions on Debato can even earn you money!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because it is still in development, many improvements can be made. If you know how Debato can become better
                                or if you encountered an issue, please help the project by sharing your thoughts on Discord!
                            </p>

                                You should definitely use Debato if you are tired of the internet shouting factory and wish to engage
                                In respectful discussions with others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because debato is built on the Steem blockchain, an account on Debato is an account on this blockchain.
                                So with that account you also have access to a variety of other apps built on Steem such as
                                <a href="https://d.tube/">D.tube</a>, <a href="https://steepshot.io/">Steepshot</a>, <a href="https://busy.org/">Busy.org</a>
                                and many more! You can browse Steem Apps <a href = "https://steemprojects.com/">here</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Steem blockhain on which Debato is built, has a diverse community of users all around the world
                                so you will surely find different perspectives, opinions and ideas to broaden your perspective.
                                Before you know it you have built your own engaging network with people from different places and cultures!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On top of all this, Debato is unique in that its users are able to earn tokens by being an active member
                                that can be traded and sold online. Also you are able to reward good discussions and arguments of others.

                                Debato is centralized and does not control what topics can be discussed or what arguments are allowed.
                                Everything that is posted is moderated and rated by the users themselves.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are the only active debate platform that is able to let users earn rewards from their statements and discussions.

                        <div class="infoItem">
                            <p>Because Debato is built on a blockchain technology with no central governance, having free account creation would
                                result in thousands of fake accounts and bots ruining the experience of honest users. To combat this there is a
                                small account creation fee to get started. The company of SteemIt, the founder of the blockchain is willing
                                to pay that fee if they can verify that you are a human. To create an account with one of these two options you can go

                                Accounts have a certain amount of voting power which is determined by the funds held by that account (Steem Power).
                                When a user upvotes your argument or discussion, his voting power will determine how much that upvote 'is worth'.
                                After 7 days, all rewards from upvotes of your post will be rewarded to you and you can claim them on your profile page.
                                When the 7 days are over, upvotes on your arguments or discussions no longer lead to rewards.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your rewards will be paid out in 'Steem', 'Steem Backed Dollars' and 'Steem Power' into your wallet.
                                More information about what these do can be found in the wallet section of your profile page.
                                When you claimed these rewards, they are in your wallet. You can choose to invest them into your account which increases
                                your voting power and increases the worth of your upvotes. You can also choose to hold the tokens in your wallet or to
                                cash out and sell the tokens for Euros, Dollars, or any other currency you like.

                                Yes, posts on a blockchain are permanent. It is possible to delete and edit posts but the original is by definition
                                stored on the blockchain forever as well.

                                Posting, commenting, voting and other transactions on the Steem blockchain are completely free!
                                But to reduce spam or endless upvoting there are limitations.
                                Performing transactions on the blockchain requires resource credits. (you can check your credits at <a href = steemd.com>steemd.com</a>)
                                The more steem power an account has, the more it is seen as a trusted account and the more transactions you can perform. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because upvotes are worth actual money, there is a system to avoid spamming here as well.
                                Each time you place a vote, your voting power is reduced by 2% (unless you do not vote at 100%).
                                So the next vote would only be worth 98% of what your first vote was worth. After voting 25 times your upvote
                                is only worth 50% of what your original vote was worth! You have to be careful and only upvote posts that really deserve the extra reward.
                                The voting power regenerates at a rate of 20% per 24 hours.

                                The rewards you earn from discussions and arguments are directly related to the quality of that post.
                                You will need to make sure your posts are accessible to a broad public, that you have a clear discussion statement
                                and an elaborate context section to inform people before engaging in the discussion. These are all factors that determine
                                whether a user will upvote your post.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you want people to engage with your discussions and arguments, make sure that you engage with other arguments and discussions
                                as well. Engaging with others is the best way to expand your network, make people follow you and to meet people with different or the same opinions.

                                Steem is a blockchain, but not in the way Bitcoin is a blockchain for example. Both of these examples are created with a specific function in mind.
                                While Bitcoin was a blockchain designed to store transaction data and allow for peer to peer transactions, Steem was designed to store content and
                                facilitate social media like systems such as upvoting, sharing, building networks and creating communities.
                                So while bitcoin has transactions as 'send X bitcoin from Y to Z', Steem has transactions such as 'Post this text as an article', 'upvote this blogpost', 'follow this user' etc.
                                On top of that, Steem has a system of creating unique coins to incentivize content creation and engagement.

                                Every 3 seconds, a block is added to the blockchain that contains all transactions performed on the network.
                                Each block also a certain amount of new tokens are created (called the reward pool) and distributed amongst the content creators.
                                The amount of tokens created each block is being phased down to reduce inflation.
                                The amount of rewards you receive depend on the amount of upvotes your post received in the last 7 days and how much Steem Power
                                your upvoters hold.

                                You can increase your Steem Power by 'powering up', which converts the Steem token into Steem Power.
                                You can get Steem tokens and Steem Power as rewards from posts or you can buy the tokens at exchanges, or with Steem Backed Dollars.
                                Powering down would mean converting Steem Power into liquid Steem tokens but powering down happens over multiple weeks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your Voting Power decreases with 2% each time you upvote a post (unless you do not vote at 100%).
                                When your first vote is worth 100% of your potential value, the next vote would only be worth 98% of that. After voting 25 times your upvote
                                is only worth 50% of what your original vote was worth! You have to be careful and only upvote posts that really deserve the extra reward.
                                The voting power regenerates at a rate of 20% per 24 hours.

                                You can vote as much as you want. But each time you place an upvote, your Voting Power decreases with 2%  (unless you do not vote at 100%).

                                Passwords on Steem are long. And they should be. A password in the wrong hands could lead to you account being jeopardized.
                                But giving your private keys each time you want to use an application built on the blockchain increases the risk of someone getting access to
                                your account. To limit this, an open source, trusted application was created called SteemConnect. Steemconnect is a tool so that you can login
                                on a trusted platform (SteemConnect) without the site having access to your private keys.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you login to Debato for example, in no way do we have access to your keys. When you log in with SteemConnect your browser gets a
                                token that allows it to perform a limited number of operations for a limited amount of time.
